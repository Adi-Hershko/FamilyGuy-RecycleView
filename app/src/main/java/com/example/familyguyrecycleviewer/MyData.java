            "Stewie is the infant son of the Griffin family but is far from a typical baby. He is highly intelligent, speaks with a British accent, and is obsessed with world domination. He often engages in comically evil schemes",
            "Brian is the family's anthropomorphic pet dog who walks on two legs, talks, and even has a writing career. He's known for his witty and often sarcastic commentary on the family's antics. Brian has a penchant for alcohol and relationships with human women.",
            "Chris is the overweight and slow-witted teenage son of Peter and Lois. He's known for his love of food, his naivety, and his somewhat endearing clumsiness. He often faces ridicule from his family and peers.",
            "Meg is the socially awkward and often overlooked teenage daughter of the Griffin family. She's constantly mocked by her family, especially her younger brother, Stewie. Meg struggles to fit in and has had her share of unfortunate experiences.",
